# graphGPT - about
This is a program for learning/debugging with ChatGPT. It knows a lot, but it's short context window is a real problem. It can go to fast, and teach you five things at once, so it really is more natural to have five conversations with it than just one. With ChatGPT, you have to erase your past conversations, with this app, you can have all the conversations and keep track of them all!

It uses the magics of Node-Edge graphs to keep track of everything! So you can go back in time, and start new branching conversations to tame your endless curiosity!

If you would like to support this project and more like it, you can buy me a coffee at [Ko-Fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/collegefishies).

# Features
  - Ability to keep track of arbitrarily complicated conversations!
  - Save/Load! your conversations for good record keeping! Now you can keep notes that openAI has no control over!
  - Intuitive Conversation Navigator! Just click on the node to start a new branching conversation!



# Usage
Make your own .env file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and then run main.py. If you have make you can just run `make auto`, to run the GUI.
If there's desire to make a more user friendly version with no API-key management let me know!
